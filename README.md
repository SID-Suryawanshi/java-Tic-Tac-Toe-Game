Tic-Tac-Toe: A Classic Command-Line Game in Java

Welcome to the repository for a complete, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Java. This project is a simple yet robust implementation of the classic game, running entirely within the command line. It's a great example of core Java concepts, including 2D arrays, user input handling, and game loop management.

‚ú® Features
This isn't just a basic game. It includes several features to create a complete user experience:

Two-Player Mode: Play against a friend, taking turns as 'X' and 'O'.

Player Choice: Decide who starts each round.

Score Tracking: The game keeps a running tally of wins for both Player X and Player O.

Play Again: After a round ends, you can instantly start a new game or choose to exit.

Robust Input Validation: The game gracefully handles invalid inputs, such as choosing a cell that is already taken or is outside the board's boundaries.

Clean & Readable Board: The game board is printed in a clear, formatted way after every move.

üöÄ How to Run the Game
To play the game, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

(Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub details.)

Compile the Java File:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the Java compiler.

javac MyGame.java

This will create a MyGame.class file.

Run the Game:
Now, execute the compiled code.

java MyGame

The game will start in your terminal. Enjoy!
